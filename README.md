# CompassApp - React Native Educational Management App

The CompassApp project is a React Native-based mobile application designed to facilitate educational management and enhance student engagement within the Compass educational program. The app aims to provide a centralized and intuitive platform for students and faculty to track and improve their academic progress, attendance, and study hours.

Key Features:

Guided Mastery Framework: The app aligns with the Compass program's guided mastery framework, focusing on fostering skill development and improvement rather than simply averaging grades. Students are evaluated based on levels of mastery in target skills, encouraging continuous growth.
    
Comprehensive Data Organization: CompassApp offers a centralized location to organize and access a variety of data related to student performance, including mastery levels on assignments over time, attendance records, study hours performed, missed classes, missed appointments, and study hours needed to pass.
    
Faculty and Student Data Entry: The app enables faculty members to enter selected data directly through the app or through integration with other platforms like Canvas or Google. Similarly, students can input data such as mastery levels for specific skills, providing a comprehensive view of their progress.
    
QR Code Integration: CompassApp utilizes QR codes for efficient student interaction. Students can use QR codes to "scan in" and "scan out" of study hours, ensuring accurate tracking of their study commitments. Additionally, a QR code allows students to register their attendance in class quickly.
    
Mastery Level Graphs: The app generates graphical representations of mastery level changes over time for each target skill. These graphs provide visual insights into student progress and help identify areas where further improvement may be required.

The project aims to leverage the power of React Native, ensuring cross-platform compatibility for both iOS and Android devices. It utilizes a SQLite database to store user information securely and supports development using Visual Studio Code (VSCode), a widely adopted code editor in the React Native community.

By building the CompassApp, we aim to provide a powerful tool that empowers students to take control of their educational journey while assisting faculty in effectively managing and monitoring student progress within the Compass educational program.
